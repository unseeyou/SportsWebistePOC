# SBHS HSC Project: Website Concept for better management of student sports data
## Functionality:
### 1. Fast, automatic visualisation of data
Generate overviews for sports attendance based on a variety of factors through plotly

### 2. Streamlined process to detect students who have not met attendance quota
Better ways to exempt certain dates, and automatically checking each student for their attendance.

## Instructions:
### 1. Run app.py
Don't set up a default flask profile because then it won't use localhost which breaks the oidc login system
